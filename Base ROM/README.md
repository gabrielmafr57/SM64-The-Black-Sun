In this folder you will find the newest ROM. (Of course it won't be a pure ROM, it will be a PPF patch)
Every Base ROM is packed into a RAR. The rar contains the:

- ROM (as PPF Patch)
- The source files/patches used for the hack.
- A txt file, which has a summary of all edits/changes/patches has been did to the ROM.

The Base ROM's name is as following:
"SM64BS X-XX-XX.ppf"

The X is the date when it was released, for example:
"SM64BS 4-23-13.ppf"

Also, the first upcoming Base ROMs will be Alpha versions, containing not much code. When the right
step has been done, it will be announced as Beta and later released. The Pre-Alpha ROMs won't be
here. So, it will take a while until the first Base ROM will come up. Maybe, I might release
atleast a little demo, but not more than that. Only the officiall Alpha will be here and so on
updated.
