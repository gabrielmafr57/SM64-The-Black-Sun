=========================================================================================
There are four levels of game access(read, write) in SM64. I'm explaining them here:

Level 1:
- RAM Editing, C coding, GameShark
- Simple Hex Editing outside of Checksum. (Strings like the beginning string: "SUPER MARIO 64"
- Compression and Decompression + Recompression.

Level 2:
- Checksum Access (Being able to recalculate the checksum or skip it) + Checksum edits like the "START GAME" string, etc.
- Limited ROM Access (Cannot edit hardcoded stuff like: Hardcoded pointers, hardcoded camera stuff, etc.)
- Shading, Lighting
- Level Importation, Objects Editing
- Toad's Tool 64.

Level 3:
- Full ROM Access (Being able to edit hardcoded stuff)
- Uploading stuff through ROM. (DMA Channeling)

Level 4:
- Access to "private" and "protected" variables. 
- Full ROM Access.

Level 5:
- Full ROM Access including all variables.
- Compiling own (written in C) code to be compiled into ROM, not RAM.
